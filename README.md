# 1ButtonStall
This program makes it easier to set up 1 button stall for controller players on epic games / PC. 

# IMPORTANT!

Step 1.
Place the bat file and .py file in your users folder, and drag bat. For me, that would be: C:\Users\trevy

Step 2.
Open the py file in any text editor (notepad is fine) and continue with the instructions from there.

Ultimately, you will be able to double click the bat file and the 1 button stall will be added to the config, opposed to opening and pasting the code into the config everytime you launch the game.
