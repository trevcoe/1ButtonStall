# 1ButtonStall
This program makes it easier to set up 1 button stall for controller players on epic games / PC. 

# IMPORTANT!

Step 1.
Place the bat file and .py file in your users folder. For me, that would be: C:\Users\trevy.

Step 2.
Drag stall.bat.lnk to your desktop. Stall.bat.lnk is a dekstop shortcut, you will double click this to run the program.

Step 3.
Open the py file in any text editor (notepad is fine) and continue with the instructions from there.

Ultimately, you will be able to double click the bat shortcut and the 1 button stall will be added to the config, opposed to opening and pasting the code into the config everytime you launch the game.
